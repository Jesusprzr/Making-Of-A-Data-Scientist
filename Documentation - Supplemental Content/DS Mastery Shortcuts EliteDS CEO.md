We are currently going through the fourth industrial revolution -> the artificial intelligence revolution, a **data driven** revolution.

# Secret Nº 1
Machine Learning is not about fancy algorithms. <- This is a piece of the puzzle.

Machine Learning is about teaching a computer through self-learned patterns from the data.

     Programming -> Data + Program = Output
     Machine Learning -> Data + Output = Program

The goal of *ML* is to simplify a large amount of data into a simple prediction or task to solve a problem or need.

# Secret Nº2
Machine Learning != Black Box

     Academic ML -> Obssesed over those algorithms
     Applied ML -> Focused on results

Secret Nº3
First you need an idea of how the whole puzzle looks like in order to start arming the puzzle piece by piece.

     Exploratory Analysis -> Scouting ahead before loosing yourself on the woods.

#Secret Nº 4
Better Data > Fancier Algorithms

A cleaned dataset can boost your model's performance.

# Secret Nº5 
Domain Knowledge = Competitive Advantage

     Garbage Data + Irrelevant Features = Useless Model

# Secret Nº 6
Learn the most general purpose algorithms that will give you the foundations.

     Effectiveness vs Versatility vs Limitations <- Look at these

Examples:

Linear Regression cool for modeling linear relationships BUT not for non-lienar relationships.

Decision Trees good for non-linear relationships But easy to overfit.

Tree Ensembles -> Random Forest & Boosted Trees <- Decision Trees with tuneable attributes for not overfitting. 

# Secret Nº 7
Treat your data as limited resources

You need so separate your data into a training and test subsets. Commonly an 80/20. And don't even look at your test data until you are ready to test your final model.

Hyperparameters are key higher-level structure settings that we tune into our algorithm before using it. Them after you have done cross-validation to test your hyperparameters yo

# Secret Nº 8
Don't reinvent the wheel.

Most data scientists DON'T need to code their algorithms from scratch.

     Efficiency and effectiveness above everything else -> be resourceful, think clearly, and have results. That's what matters.

You don't need to know all the underlying theory to apply ML on an effective way.

# Secret Nº 9
You don't need to know much code, the syntax is pretty straightforward and everything is about:

Take the right tools, in the right way, in the right place.

# Secret Nº 10
Learn everythin in context! **<---- THE NUMBER ONE SHORTCUT TO MASTERY**

Learn in context with realistic end-to-end projects!
- Use real world datasets
- Pick real world objectives
- Go through the full Data Science process.

Models: Deal with model complexity to understand what they are, how to use, and where to use them.
