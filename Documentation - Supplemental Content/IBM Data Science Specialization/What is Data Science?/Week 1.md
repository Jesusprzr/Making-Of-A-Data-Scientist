# Defining Data Science
This definition could be really broad, which makes sense since data scientists need to know about different fields such as programming, analytics, math, communication, field related acumen, etc. But at the end of the day, no matter how, the ultimate goal of a data scientist is:

*Bring bussiness value through the study of data.*

# What Do Data Scientists Do?
Well... Now that I went through all of this, I can say that the definition of what is Data Science and what is a Data Scientist could be more broad. Specially for the fact that there are so many tools, ways of using data, also sizes of data. 

Data Scientist use algorithms such as regression, clustering, classification, etc. They also use different sizes of data, starting with as little as a common excel spreadsheet and as big as cloud mantained databases that you need to manipulate with hadoop for how sized it is. They also have to communicate their findings in a pretty good way so everyone can understand what it means and them take decisions based on those findings.

There is people who labels data scientist for the size of their data, for whether they use, or don't use algorithms, etc. But as the author states and is really brilliant from my perspective. Engineers do what engineers do. They solve problems and build a better world with their work.

*So data scientists do what data scientists do. They build a better world and solve problems through data.*

# IBM Watson Image Classification
Had an introductory project using an image classification algorithm from IBM Watson Studio and it was pretty curious, since I upploaded various hard to identify images and the algorithm was able to identify the majority accuratedly in various ways while some others that were frankly really hard to discern, it didn't got anything right besides of the colors. 

### Here you have a sample of the image classification algorithm
