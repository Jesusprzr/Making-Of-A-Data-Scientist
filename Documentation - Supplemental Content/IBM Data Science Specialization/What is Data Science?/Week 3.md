# Applications Of Data Science & Recruiting Data Scientists
### A company to improve need:

    for improve in company:
      if measure in improve:
        if data in measure:
          if collect in data:
            data.collect((for measure) to improve)
            
Archived data (better if well documentet/structured) = Bussiness value (through algoritms and analytics)

Garbage In = Garbage Out -> no matter how good your data scientist is

Create a D.S. Team to work with your data

### Recruiting Data Scientists
Don't look for an unicorn. Instead focus on looking into your applicants poll and look for the ones with your companies DNA and who fills your needs the most. Anyone can learn analytic skills if they want to, but great D.S's are the ones who are really passionated about the field you're in, are curious, and really want to solve the problems you are facing in the field.

**While looking for a D.S.**
1. **Curiosity rules them all** <- The first thing to look for on a D.S. 
2. **Problem Solving Abilities**
3. **Sense of humor** (communicational skills)
4. **Technical skills**

**From the technical skills point of view** (of course, it depends on the type of situation and environment you want to work on)
- Market research -> some statistical knowledge, some algorithms, machine learning algos.
- Big data -> ability to store and manipulate data (at higher scales) and then the ability to apply algos to those large sets of data.
- Traditional predictive analytics environments -> R, Stata, Python.
- Unestructured data -> Python is more suitable than R.
- Big data -> Hadoop & Spark.
- **It all depends on the kind of field you want to work on**

Communication skills are equally as important, just imagine you found a new insight, discovered the reason of a problem and/or its solution, or had an unexpected outcome and now you need to communicate it to your client, boss, etc. The ability to communicate it on a compelling and understandable way that gets them pumped and inspired to work on it is equally as important.

D.S. Applications vary from medical research, augmented reality, geographical distributions, search engines, recommendation systems, etc.

**All models are wrong, they are usefull but they are wrong.** <- yah know, the free lunch theorem

But all the models, experiments, analysis, and algorithms (if used ethically and correctly) are allowing us to create a better world.

**The final deliverable**
The ultimate purpose of analytics is to communicate findings to the concerned who might use these insights to formulate policy or strategy. Analytics summarize findings in tables and plots. Use those insights to build the narrative to communicate the findings is part of the D.S. Work. This is why before starting your analysis you should know the scope of the final delivery -> Deliverate the key message and then look for the data and analytics you need to make that the case. **The initial planning and conceptualization are extremely important for producing a senseful and compelling document.**

# The Report Structure
The structure of the report depends on the lenght of the document.

Brief report = To the point and presents a summary of the key findings

Detailed report = Incrementally builds the argument and contains details other relevant works, research methodology, data sources, and intermediate findings along with the main results.

The length of the report depends largely on the purpose of it:
- Bierf reports -> Drafted as commentaries on current trends and developments that attracted public or media attention
- Detailed reports -> Offer critical review of the subject matter with extensive analysis and commentary. These often collect new data or interview industry experts to answer the research questions.

Even if the report is brief (<= 5 pages):

    Cover Page -> Table Of Contents -> Executive Summary -> Detailed Contents -> Acknowledgements -> References -> Apendices (if needed)

*Cover page should include (at minimum):*
- Title of the report
- Names of authors 
- Their affiliations
- Their contacts
- Name of institutional publisher (if there is one)
- Date of publication

*Table of contents (ToC):*
- Is like a map for a trip never done before (you should get a sense of the journey before embarking)
- It provides a visual proxy for the actual travel with details about landmarks that you will pass by in the trip
- Main headings and lists of tables and figures offer a glimpse of what lies ahead in the document.

*Abstract or executive summary:*
- Explain the crux of your arguments in three paragraphs or less. For long documents could be longer.

*Introductory section:*
- Set up the problem, gently introduction to the subject matter.

*Literature review:*
- A review of available relevant research of the subject of matter. Here you also introduce your research questions and hypothesis (you wil also highlight gaps in the existing knowledge that you will try to fill).

*Methodology:*
- Introduce research methods and data sources used for the analysis. 
- Refer to the *literature review* to bolster your choices for variables, data, and methods and how they will help you answer the research questions. 
- If you've collected new data, explain it in some detail.

*Results:*
- Is where you present your empirical findings. Starting with descriptive stats and illustrative graphics, and then move toward formally testing your hypothesis.
- If need to run statistical models, you might turn to regression, or categorical analysis. Gotta take in count if working with time series data.
- You can also report results from other empirical techniques that fall under the general rubric of data mining.
- Fancy reports are cool, but without compromising the message, they often rely on illustrative graphics to summarize the results <- If the summary fits perfect the data, then the report works!

*Discussion section:*
- Here you craft the main arguments by building on the results you presented earlier.
- Here you rely on the power of narrative to enable numbers to communicate your thesis to the readers.
- Refer the reader to the research question and knowledge gaps early identified.
- Highlight how the findings provide the missing pieces of the puzzle.

Complete answers are not always the case, and that's fine.

*Conclusion:*
- Generalize your specific findings.
- Identify future possible developments in research and application that can result from your research.

*Housekeeping including a list of:*
- References section.
- Acknowledgement section.
- Appendices (if needed).
