# Applications Of Data Science & Recruiting Data Scientists
### A company to improve need:

    for improve in company:
      if measure in improve:
        if data in measure:
          if collect in data:
            data.collect((for measure) to improve)
            
Archived data (better of well documentet) = Bussiness value (through algoritms and analytics)

Garbage In = Garbage Out -> no matter how good your data scientist is

### Recruiting Data Scientists
Don't look for an unicorn. Instead focus on looking into your applicants poll and look for the ones with your companies DNA and who fills your needs the most. Anyone can learn analytic skills if they want to, but great D.S's are the ones who are really passionated about the field you're in, are curious, and really want to solve the problems you are facing in the field.

**While looking for a D.S.**
1. **Curiosity rules them all** <- The first thing to look for on a D.S. 
2. **Problem Solving Abilities**
3. **Sense of humor** (communicational skills)
4. **Technical skills**

**From the technical skills point of view** (of course, it depends on the type of situation and environment you want to work on)
- Market research -> some statistical knowledge, some algorithms, machine learning algos.
- Big data -> ability to store and manipulate data (at higher scales) and then the ability to apply algos to those large sets of data.
- Traditional predictive analytics environments -> R, Stata, Python.
- Unestructured data -> Python is more suitable than R.
- Big data -> Hadoop & Spark.
- **It all depends on the kind of field you want to work on**

Communication skills are equally as important, just imagine you found a new insight, discovered the reason of a problem and/or its solution, or had an unexpected outcome and now you need to communicate it to your client, boss, etc. The ability to communicate it on a compelling and understandable way that gets them pumped and inspired to work on it is equally as important.

D.S. Applications vary from medical research, augmented reality, geographical distributions, search engines, recommendation systems, etc.

**All models are wrong, they are usefull but they are wrong.** <- yah know, the free lunch theorem

But all the models, experiments, analysis, and algorithms (if used ethically and correctly) are allowing us to create a better world.

**The final deliverable**
The ultimate purpose of analytics is to communicate findings to the concerned who might use these insights to formulate policy or strategy. Analytics summarize findings in tables and plots. Use those insights to build the narrative to communicate the findings is part of the D.S. Work. This is why before starting your analysis you should know the scope of the final delivery -> Deliverate the key message and then look for the data and analytics you need to make that the case. **The initial planning and conceptualization are extremely important for producing a senseful and compelling document.**
