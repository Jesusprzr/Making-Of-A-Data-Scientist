# Chapter 2 - Descriptive Statistics
## Who was the best baseball player of all time?
Descriptive statistics are the numbers and calculations we use to **summarize** raw data.

There are two questions to address that have the similarity of being able to show us the strenghts and limitations of descriptive statistics:
1. What is happening to the economic health of America's middle class?
2. Who was the greatest baseball player of all times?

Derek Jeter had a career batting average of .313. That's a descriptive/summary statistic. <- This batting average is a gross simplification of Jeter's seventeen seasons. It is easy to understand, elegant in its simplicity AND limited in what it can tell us.

Let's change to a less trivial subject.

Ideally, we would like a simple but accurate measure of how the economic well-being of the typical american worker has been changing in recent years. A reasonable answer would be to calculate the per capita income over the course of a generation (which is approximately 30 years).
