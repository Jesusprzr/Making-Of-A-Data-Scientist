# Chapter 2 - Descriptive Statistics
## Who was the best baseball player of all time?
Descriptive statistics are the numbers and calculations we use to **summarize** raw data.

There are two questions to address that have the similarity of being able to show us the strenghts and limitations of descriptive statistics:
1. What is happening to the economic health of America's middle class?
2. Who was the greatest baseball player of all times?

Derek Jeter had a career batting average of .313. That's a descriptive/summary statistic. <- This batting average is a gross simplification of Jeter's seventeen seasons. It is easy to understand, elegant in its simplicity AND limited in what it can tell us.

Let's change to a less trivial subject.

Ideally, we would like a simple but accurate measure of how the economic well-being of the typical american worker has been changing in recent years. A reasonable answer would be to calculate the per capita income over the course of a generation (which is approximately 30 years).

Per capita income is a simple average calculated dividing the total income divided by population size. It climbed from 7787$ in 1980 to 26487$ in 2010 (latest year from which government had data by the time of writing this book). This calculation is technically correct and totally incorrect in terms of the asked question:
1. He didn't took inflation in count, so these 7787 dollars from 1980 would be 19600 nowdays.
2. Average income in America is NOT equal to the income of the average American.
   * Average income in America takes the WHOLE income and divides it by the population but this isn't telling my nothing about who is earning how much of that income in none of both years.

Here we see that in both answers, the outcome is non-to-parcially correct. In both cases, what the author did is ask experts in both fields -> which statistics they would use to measure the related questions. 

Descriptive statistics are the way we have to encapsulate a raw array of data, i.e. There are 330 million residents in the U.S. A spreadsheet with the name of income of every american would contain the information we could ever want about the economic health of the country, but it tells us nothing at all for how unwieldy it is.

Descriptive statistics give us manageable and meaningful summary of the underlying phenomenon. BUT any simplification invites abuse.

There are 10 guys sitting on bar stools in a stablishment in Seattle, each ones income is 35K so the mean income is 35K. Then Bill Gates enters with a talking parrot perched on his shoulder and sits on the 11 bench. Bill's income is 1 billion (is not), so the mean income increases to about 91 million dollars <- **This is because the mean is really sensitive to outliers.** And this is the perfect explanation why we shouldn't use the per capita income to calculate the change in economic health in middle class americans.

We have another summary statistic that is not the mean and can help us to calculate **the middle of a distribution.** This statistic is called the median, which divides a distribution in the half of its observations (if observations are even, then our median is the midpoint calculated between the two middle observations).

With the median being our descriptive stat. Even with Warren Buffet comming in and sitting next to Bill, the median would still be 35K (it would be the guy sitting on the sixth stool).
