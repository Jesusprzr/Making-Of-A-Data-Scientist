# Precision != Accuracy
I'm playing golf with Bill Gates:

Accuracy -> Bill uses the standard yardage markers (which gives distance only to the center of the green)

Precision -> I'm using a golf range finder with a laser (gives exact distance to the point you target)

Bill defeates me tremendously <- Why?

I rellied on the precision of my range finder and didn't took in count various factors:
- I never realized during the game that the device was set to meters instead of yards, which makes all my calculations erroneous.
- I would sometimes inadvertenly aim the laser bean at the trees behind the green. 

What's the lesson: Even the most precise measurements/calculations should be checked against common sense. Specially when those are precise because we are biasing focus towards a central point, which means that if we are wrong we are seriously wrong!

An important example of how precision can be misleading is the 2008 financial crisis:
