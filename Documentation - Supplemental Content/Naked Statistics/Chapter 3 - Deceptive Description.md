## Precision != Accuracy
I'm playing golf with Bill Gates:

Accuracy -> Bill uses the standard yardage markers (which gives distance only to the center of the green)

Precision -> I'm using a golf range finder with a laser (gives exact distance to the point you target)

Bill defeates me tremendously <- Why?

I rellied on the precision of my range finder and didn't took in count various factors:
- I never realized during the game that the device was set to meters instead of yards, which makes all my calculations erroneous.
- I would sometimes inadvertenly aim the laser bean at the trees behind the green. 

An important example of how precision can be misleading is the 2008 financial crisis:
- The risk management models of the firms, prior to the crisis were precise.
  * They quantified with precision the amount of the firm's capital that could be lost under different scenarios.
  * The answers the math of those models predict were reassuringly precise.
- The assumptions of what might happen to the global markets that were embeded to those models were just plain wrong, making conclusion not giantly inaccurate, but giangtly enough to make the models entirely wrong, useless, and desestabilizing the global economy.

What's the lesson: Even the most precise measurements/calculations should be checked against common sense. Specially when those are precise because we are biasing focus towards a central point, which means that if we are wrong we are seriously wrong!

## Reconciliating competing narratives
Is U.S. Manufacturing profitable and globally competitive, or is it shrinking to the face of intense foreign competition?

Our seeming contradiction lies in the fact of how we define the health of U.S. Manufacturing -> In terms of output or in terms of employment? 

Because once we see our data we notice something. The outcome took a robust growth that hasn't stop once the global recesion of 2008 ended, but in the other hand, emploiment has gone down a lot.

What does this means?
- It means that our manufacturing processes are becoming more efficient, which enables us to have less workers but more results and also to compete with other countries with lower manufacturing hourly wages.
- It also means that there are fewer manufacturing jobs, which is extremely bad for the displaced workers who depend on those wages.

The U.S. Is the third larger manufacturer in the world, behind China and Germany.

Is globalization making income inequality around the globe better or worst?
- By one interpretation, income inequalities has been boosted due to globalization. Because as measured by GDP por capita, rich countries just got richier tending to growth faster than poor countries during the 1980 to 2000 period.
- On the other hand, if we change the unit of analysis the same data can be interpred differently. -> We don't care about poor countries, we care about poor people. China and India happen to be two of the bigger countries in the world (population > 1 billion) but two of the poorer countries in the world. But with globalization both have rapidly grown over the past several decades. The proper analysis yields an entirely different conclusion about the benefits of globalization for the world’s poor. As the Economist points out, “If you consider people, not countries, global inequality is falling rapidly.”

**The key lesson IS to pay attention to the unit of analysis. Who or What is being described, and is that different from the Who or What being described by someone else.**

## Measuring and persuading with mean and median
Both are good measures of central tendency, but the correctness of the outcome depends on the accuracy of their use and if we use them honestly seeking the truth or for our own interests. If for some reason I would like to make the group of numbers to look big, I would focus on the mean. If I want it to look small, I will cite the median.

For example, George W. Bush tax cuts. The administrarion pointed out that Americans would recive an average in their tax reduction of 1000$. This was again, technically correct but far away from reality. The distribution of that taxt reduction was skewed by choosing a relatively small number of extremely wealthy individuals for very large tax cuts. The median of this distribution was around 100 bucks, whixh means that most of americans had non-significative tax cuts while the benefited outliers skewed the mean of the distribution making it look much bigger.

But median life expectancy figures are also misleading. Suppose that with a treatment, the median life expectancy was 8 months, but also 30 or 40 percent of patients were cured entirely. This would not show up in the median (but the mean life expectancy would look pretty impressive for those takin the drug). The outliers would be highly relevant in your decision but you wouldn't be able to spot it due to how the median makes the distribution seem much smaller.

**From the standpoint of accuracy, the median Vs mean question revolves around whether the outliers in a distribution distort what is being described or are instead an important part of the message.**

When we see just the median or mean on a distribution it could be for one of two reasons:
1. For the sake of brevity
2. Someone is looking to persuade with statistics
