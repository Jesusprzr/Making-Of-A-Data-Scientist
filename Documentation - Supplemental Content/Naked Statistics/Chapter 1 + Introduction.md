# Introduction: Why I hated calculus but love statistics
Long story short. As the tittle suggests, and as many readers had guessed. The author hated calculus because of the problem that we all face, and is that almost ANY teacher, never explains the usability, the intuition, the reason why you should learn what you learn on calculus. In this statistics book you understand the why of lots of calculus operations, and equations and learn it on a really entertaining and practical way, and that's because you are understanding the intuition behind it! The author also talks about the problem of statistics being on the wrong or less aware/intelligent hands, and it's implication for the world with the example of the titular: "Workers who go out for a break have 40% higher probabilities of having cancer" which is a totally wrong conclusion because it is not the action of having a break that produces cancer, is the fact that most people that goes out for a break is doing so because they are going to smoke. So obviously it is not having a break of work that produces cancer, but the fact of smoking. This also demostrates the facility that exists to persuade and cheat people lying with statistics. This is why we need to be aware and understand statistics, to discern these kind of people that are lying and/or trying to cheat on you with statistics.

# Chapter 1: What's The Point
There is people that likes football, and can be all day talking about the performance of a team against other team, how good or bad was their quarterback, his passer rating and all related to the sport but when someone sits in from of them to explain the Gini Index, they will start getting bored or seize up with anxiety because of the complex statistic that someone is starting to talk about. When in reality the quarterback passer rating and the Gini Index are pretty equal. Both are handy tool for collapsing complex information into a single number. 

The Gini Index as any descriptive statistics strenghts, has the capability of provide an easy way to compare the income distribution in two countries, or in a single country at different points in time. 0 is equal distribution of wealth and 1 is total inequality in distribution of wealth. Sweden	has	had	significant	economic	growth over	the	past	two	decades,	but	the	Gini	index	in	Sweden	actually fell	from	.25	in 1992	to	.23	in	2005,	meaning	that	Sweden	grew	richer	and	more	equal	over	that period.

DATA is just a fancy name for information. Statistics **helps us process** data. Sometimes that data is trivial, as the sports stats. And sometimes they offer insight into the nature of human existence, as with the Gini Index.

Hal Varian, Chief economist at Google (by that time) said that being a statistician will be "the sexy job" of the next decade. And I am pretty surprised by that statement, because 7 years have pased since the publication of this book and things are pretty much walking that way. With more data being created every day, faster and faster. and with what the newyork times said, which I think is a perfect description of it, **_"Data is merely the raw material of knowledge"_**. So, statistics is the most powerful tool we have to use that information to some meaningful end.

Here is a quick example of how statistics can bring meaning to raw data.

## Description and comparison
Here I get that statistics can encapsulate and bring meaning to data, but also there are lot of things that these statistics may not take in count (i.e. GPA doesn't take in count the difficulty of the classes the student took), also an overreliance on these statistics can lead to the wrong conclusion or behavior. Descriptive statistics exist to simplify, which implies some loss of nuance or detail, and we gotta be really aware of that fact.

## Inference
We can use the data we know to answer the data we don't know. If we want to count how many homeless people are in Chicago, it will be a titanic and expensive task to count them all. We can use sampling of a small area, and then make an inference about the homeless people of the entire city. 

A political poll done by a research organization, determined that infer in a sample of 1,000 households will produce almost the same result as contacting every household in the U.S. Of course, sampling has to be done right because if you make a mistake in the process of creating the most accurate sample, then the outcome of your inference can be totally disastrous. 

## Assessing risk and other probability-related events
- People do win on the casino, but casinos always win on the long run due the the probabilities (even if those are really little) that they have in their favor. 
- Businesses engineer processes that make the probabilities of adverse outcome acceptably low.
- The 2008 crisis was predictable. The things that caused the crisis were extremely unlikely under W.S. Firms probabilities, but those models that tehy had were flawed, and their data too limited.
- Any model, to deal with risk must have probability as its foundation.
- The insurance industry makes money out of charging premiums that that are more than sufficient to pay for the expected payouts.
- With probability we can spot cheat. If something extremely unlikely to happen, happens. There is room for the possibility of what happened being a cheat.
- An statistical anomaly does not prove wrongdoing. There was a man that won the lottery in 2008 and again in 2011. The possibility of this happening was 1 on 25 trillion. We cannot arrest him for fraud on the basis of this calculation (of course, we might inquire whether he has any relatives who work for the state lottery). 
- Probability is one weapon in an arsenal that **requires good judgement.**
