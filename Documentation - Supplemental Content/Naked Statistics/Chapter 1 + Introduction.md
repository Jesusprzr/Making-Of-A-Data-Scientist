# Introduction: Why I hated calculus but love statistics
Long story short. As the tittle suggests, and as many readers had guessed. The author hated calculus because of the problem that we all face, and is that almost ANY teacher, never explains the usability, the intuition, the reason why you should learn what you learn on calculus. In this statistics book you understand the why of lots of calculus operations, and equations and learn it on a really entertaining and practical way, and that's because you are understanding the intuition behind it! The author also talks about the problem of statistics being on the wrong or less aware/intelligent hands, and it's implication for the world with the example of the titular: "Workers who go out for a break have 40% higher probabilities of having cancer" which is a totally wrong conclusion because it is not the action of having a break that produces cancer, is the fact that most people that goes out for a break is doing so because they are going to smoke. So obviously it is not having a break of work that produces cancer, but the fact of smoking. This also demostrates the facility that exists to persuade and cheat people lying with statistics. This is why we need to be aware and understand statistics, to discern these kind of people that are lying and/or trying to cheat on you with statistics.

# Chapter 1: What's The Point
There is people that likes football, and can be all day talking about the performance of a team against other team, how good or bad was their quarterback, his passer rating and all related to the sport but when someone sits in from of them to explain the Gini Index, they will start getting bored or seize up with anxiety because of the complex statistic that someone is starting to talk about. When in reality the quarterback passer rating and the Gini Index are pretty equal. Both are handy tool for collapsing complex information into a single number. 

The Gini Index as any descriptive statistics strenghts, has the capability of provide an easy way to compare the income distribution in two countries, or in a single country at different points in time. 0 is equal distribution of wealth and 1 is total inequality in distribution of wealth. Sweden	has	had	significant	economic	growth over	the	past	two	decades,	but	the	Gini	index	in	Sweden	actually fell	from	.25	in 1992	to	.23	in	2005,	meaning	that	Sweden	grew	richer	and	more	equal	over	that period.

DATA is just a fancy name for information. Statistics **helps us process** data. Sometimes that data is trivial, as the sports stats. And sometimes they offer insight into the nature of human existence, as with the Gini Index.

Hal Varian, Chief economist at Google (by that time) said that being a statistician will be "the sexy job" of the next decade. And I am pretty surprised by that statement, because 7 years have pased since the publication of this book and things are pretty much walking that way. With more data being created every day, faster and faster. and with what the newyork times said, which I think is a perfect description of it, **_"Data is merely the raw material of knowledge"_**. So, statistics is the most powerful tool we have to use that information to some meaningful end.

Here is a quick example of how statistics can bring meaning to raw data.

## Description and comparison
Here I get that statistics can encapsulate and bring meaning to data, but also there are lot of things that these statistics may not take in count (i.e. GPA doesn't take in count the difficulty of the classes the student took), also an overreliance on these statistics can lead to the wrong conclusion or behavior. Descriptive statistics exist to simplify, which implies some loss of nuance or detail, and we gotta be really aware of that fact.

## Inference
We can use the data we know to answer the data we don't know. If we want to count how many homeless people are in Chicago, it will be a titanic and expensive task to count them all. We can use sampling of a small area, and then make an inference about the homeless people of the entire city. 

A political poll done by a research organization, determined that infer in a sample of 1,000 households will produce almost the same result as contacting every household in the U.S. Of course, sampling has to be done right because if you make a mistake in the process of creating the most accurate sample, then the outcome of your inference can be totally disastrous. 

## Assessing risk and other probability-related events
- People do win on the casino, but casinos always win on the long run due the the probabilities (even if those are really little) that they have in their favor. 
- Businesses engineer processes that make the probabilities of adverse outcome acceptably low.
- The 2008 crisis was predictable. The things that caused the crisis were extremely unlikely under W.S. Firms probabilities, but those models that they had were flawed, and their data too limited.
- Any model, to deal with risk must have probability as its foundation.
- The insurance industry makes money out of charging premiums that that are more than sufficient to pay for the expected payouts.
- With probability we can spot cheat. If something extremely unlikely to happen, happens. There is room for the possibility of what happened being a cheat.
- An statistical anomaly does not prove wrongdoing. There was a man that won the lottery in 2008 and again in 2011. The possibility of this happening was 1 on 25 trillion. We cannot arrest him for fraud on the basis of this calculation (of course, we might inquire whether he has any relatives who work for the state lottery). 
- Probability is one weapon in an arsenal that **requires good judgement.**

## Identifying important relationships (statistical detective work)
We can't conduct an analysis on humans if we expect an adverse outcome, that's why getting to the conclusion of smoking being a causality of cancer wasn't that straight forward. Also there are more implications to that. If we are about to see the outcome at the twentieth reunion, smokers are less likely to show up. We also can't simply do that without having control and experimental groups, because there are more issues that could affect the health of the subject. And at the fortieth reunion, our bias will be more serious because the health of the subjects obviously will have greater chances of being worst.

The data present unorganized cluesâ€”the crime scene, and we can't do experimental research. Statistical analysis is the detective work that crafts the raw data into some meaningful conclusion. Regression analysis is the tool that enables researchers to isolate a relationship between two variables. The problem with these type of analysis is that they can isolate a strong association between two varables by statistical analysis, but we cannot explain why that relationship exists, which means that we don't certaintly know if there is causality. **The point of statistics is to learn things that inform our lives.**

## Lies, damned lies, and statistics
We live in a real, complex, and non perfect world. Data is not perfect, and often, neither easy or cheap to collect. It is mostly possible that not only our data, but any other circumstance can affect our data, which will ultimately change our outcome in ways that we haven't think off. All these problems are magnified as our question gets more subjective, because is less quantifiable and more broad to answer. This leads us to even on the best circumstances, intellectually honest individuals may seem skeptical, or even disagree about statistical results or ther implications. But of course, we conduct statistical analysis with the best tools we have
