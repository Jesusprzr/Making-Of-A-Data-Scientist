# Introduction: Why I hated calculus but love statistics
Long story short. As the tittle suggests, and as many readers had guessed. The author hated calculus because of the problem that we all face, and is that almost ANY teacher, never explains the usability, the intuition, the reason why you should learn what you learn on calculus. In this statistics book you understand the why of lots of calculus operations, and equations and learn it on a really entertaining and practical way, and that's because you are understanding the intuition behind it! The author also talks about the problem of statistics being on the wrong or less aware/intelligent hands, and it's implication for the world with the example of the titular: "Workers who go out for a break have 40% higher probabilities of having cancer" which is a totally wrong conclusion because it is not the action of having a break that produces cancer, is the fact that most people that goes out for a break is doing so because they are going to smoke. So obviously it is not having a break of work that produces cancer, but the fact of smoking. This also demostrates the facility that exists to persuade and cheat people lying with statistics. This is why we need to be aware and understand statistics, to discern these kind of people that are lying and/or trying to cheat on you with statistics.
