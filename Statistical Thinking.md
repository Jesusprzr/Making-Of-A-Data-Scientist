#   Book procedures
The organization of this book follows the same process that the author uses when he starts working with datasets:
1.  Importing and cleaning
2.  Single variable explorations+
3.  Pair-wise explorations
4.  Multivariate Analysis
5.  Estimation and hypothesis testing
6.  Visualization

The book presents a computational approach instead of a mathematical one:
-   Most ideas are presented in python code, rather than mathematical notation.
-   Each chapter includes exercises for effective learning.
-   Some exercises include experiments to test statistical behavior.
-   Mathematically hard to grasp ideas = easy to understand by simulation (So True!)
-   Since the book is based on python, readers can import data from almost any source.

The book presents a project based approach, in which we will be working on a case study that runs through all the chapters using data from two sources:
    1.  The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)
    2.  The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
