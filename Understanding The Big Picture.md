# Introduction
This documment is aimed to help us understand the big picture of how the realms of *Data Science* and *Machine Learning* fit together in the overall puzzle and to see how is the workflow of this process.

## Breaking It Down
Let's start by breaking the whole puzzle into peaces and then, diving a little deeper into each piece to grasp how the process occurs, and finally fit them together to make sense of the whole.

### What goes into a succeful model:
The process can be structured into a few steps. I won't enummerate it, because depending on the situation you might start by one or another and then jump back and forward between them. I'll just put first the steps that normally come first.
  *  Exploratory Analysis
  *  Data Cleaning
  *  Feature Engineering
  *  Algorithm Selection
  *  Model Training
  * Other
