Didn't found it intuitive, the author assumes that the reader has knowledge and doesn't even points that.
I just will say that I wasn't learning much and I was really upset because I constantly had to guess, look for the logic or search on the internet the stuff I didn't found on the book or the author didn't explained. Also the author uses a library that he has build and that destroys the process of learning the syntax and usability of the real data science libraries. The statistical concepts are hardly explained and when it comes to practice since you don't understand the concept yet and the practical use of the concept is applied in one particular event you never get to understand the concepts even on a average level.
