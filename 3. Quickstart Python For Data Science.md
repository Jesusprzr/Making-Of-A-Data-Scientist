## A quick Note
For this guide, I assume that you took the same courses as me, so you are already familiarized with the python basic syntax and basic statistics. If not, I encourage you to read the [original guide](https://elitedatascience.com/python-quickstart) which explains more in depth everything done here. 

## 1 - Installing Anaconda & Jupyter notebooks
Before start doing data science with python, I highly recommend you watching [this](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111) quick Udacity course about Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks that will get you started with the anaconda/Jupyter workflow, and also of course it will show you how to install the sofware (nothing complicated). 

## 2 - Create A New Notebook
Once everything is up and runing, open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda and create a folder in which you will save your Python/Jupyter related files. Then, in that folder create a new Python 3 notebook. This is the notebook that we are going to use through this quickstart guide.

## 3 - Do Some Math
Do some mathematical operations, to run the code in the cell, just press *shift+enter*:
            
            import math
            
            #Area of a circle with radius 8 
            64*math.pi
            201.06192982974676
            
            #Common arithmetic operations
            2*20
            40
            18 / 3
            6.0
            19 // 3
            6
            19 % 3
            1
           
            #Length of triangle's hypotenuse 
            math.sqrt(9**2 + 16**2)
            18.35755975068582
            
            #Printing a mesage with the hypotenuse:
            m = "the lenght of the hypotenuse is"
            c = math.sqrt(9**2 + 16**2)
            print(m, c)
            the lenght of the hypotenuse is 18.35755975068582
    
## 4 - Import DS Libraries
Thanks to the fact that we installed Python and Jupyter notebook with Ananconda, we can go straight and import our libraries:

            import pandas as pd
 
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            %matplotlib inline
 
            from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
(It could take a while to run the above code)

### What the fuck we've just done?
 1. We imported *pandas* with the alias *pd*.
    * *Pandas = pd*
 2. We imported a module called *pyplot* with the alias *plt* from the *matplotlib* library. We just need that module, that's why we didn't imported the whole library.
    * *pyplot = plt*
    * *matplolib = our main plotting library*
 3. *%matplotlib inline* is simply to tell *jupyter notebook* to display the plots inside the notebook instead of on another tab.
 4. At last, we importet a *linear regression algorithm* from the *scikit-learn* library.
 
There are plenty of libraries, but the ones above, together with some others like *numpy* are the most commonly used.

## 5 - Import Your Dataset
Now we are entering the realms of *pandas*. It has an [*API*](https://medium.com/@perrysetgo/what-exactly-is-an-api-69f36968a41f) (code that allows applications to communicate with one another)  called [*IO Tools*](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html) that allows us to read and write data.

The data that we are going to use is a CSV file (Excel file) about the energy efficiency of buildings (you don't need excel to continue). First of all, [download](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00242/ENB2012_data.xlsx) the file and store it on the same folder where you saved this notebook that we are currently working on (so you can read the file directly without worrying about writing directories). 

Now use the following code to read the *dataframe* (*df* is just an abreviation we are using for *dataframe*, you can call it watherver you want). 

            df = pd.read_excel( 'ENB2012_data.xlsx' )
            
If you saved the file on a subfolder (a folder inside the notebook folder). Then you gotta specify it on your code:
            
            df = pd.read_excel( 'subfolder_name/ENB2012_data.xlsx' )

Now that we have imported (open file for reading = import) our dataset, we can check its first five lines of content with the following code:
            
            df.head()
            
## 6 - Explore The Dataset
Let's take a quick look of the distribution of our variables. 

Let's start with our first variable *"X1"*. Which as you can check in the [dataset dictionary](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency) refers to *"Relative Compactness"*.

            plt.hist(df.X1)

Functions like *hist()* have different parameters that allows us to control things like color scheme, bins used, which data goes on which axes, etc.

Instead of memorizing every parameter, get used to check the [documentation page](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html) of the funtion. You will find there all the information you need related to the function and it will give you a clear idea of what you can do with it. 
Now that we know what the parameter bins does, let's use it to have a better representation of our distribution on *X1*.

            plt.hist( df.X1, bins=5 )
