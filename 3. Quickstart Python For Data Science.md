## 1 - Installing Anaconda & Jupyter notebooks
Before start doing data science with python, I highly recommend you watching [this](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111) quick Udacity course about Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks that will get you started with the anaconda/Jupyter workflow, and also of course it will show you how to install the sofware (nothing complicated). 

## 2 - Create A New Notebook
Once everything is up and runing, open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda and create a folder in which you will save your Python/Jupyter related files. Then, in that folder create a new Python 3 notebook. This is the notebook that we are going to use through this quickstart guide.

## 3 - Do Some Math
Do some mathematical operations, to run the code just press *shift+enter* to run the cell:
            
    import math
    #Area of a circle with radius 8 
    64*math.pi
    201.06192982974676
    #Common Aritmethic operations
    2*20
    40
    18 / 3
    6.0
    19 // 3
    6
    19 % 3
    1
    #Length of triangle's hypotenuse 
    math.sqrt(9**2 + 16**2)
    18.35755975068582
