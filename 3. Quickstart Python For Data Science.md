## A quick Note
In this tutorial, I assume that you took the same courses as me, so you are already familiarized with the python basic syntax. If not, I encourage you to read the [original guide](https://elitedatascience.com/python-quickstart) which explains more in depth eveyting done here. 

## 1 - Installing Anaconda & Jupyter notebooks
Before start doing data science with python, I highly recommend you watching [this](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111) quick Udacity course about Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks that will get you started with the anaconda/Jupyter workflow, and also of course it will show you how to install the sofware (nothing complicated). 

## 2 - Create A New Notebook
Once everything is up and runing, open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda and create a folder in which you will save your Python/Jupyter related files. Then, in that folder create a new Python 3 notebook. This is the notebook that we are going to use through this quickstart guide.

## 3 - Do Some Math
Do some mathematical operations, to run the code in the cell, just press *shift+enter*:
            
            import math
            
            #Area of a circle with radius 8 
            64*math.pi
            201.06192982974676
            
            #Common Aritmethic operations
            2*20
            40
            18 / 3
            6.0
            19 // 3
            6
            19 % 3
            1
           
            #Length of triangle's hypotenuse 
            math.sqrt(9**2 + 16**2)
            18.35755975068582
            
            #Printing a mesage with the hypotenuse:
            m = "the lenght of the hypotenuse is"
            c = math.sqrt(9**2 + 16**2)
            print(m, c)
            the lenght of the hypotenuse is 18.35755975068582
    
## 4 - Import DS Libraries
Thanks to the fact that we installed Python and Jupyter notebook with Ananconda, we can go straight and import our libraries:

            import pandas as pd
 
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            %matplotlib inline
 
            from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
(It could take a while to run the above code)

### What the fuck we've just done?
 1. We imported *pandas* with the alias *pd*.
    * *Pandas = pd*
 2. We imported a module called *pyplot* with the alias *plt* from the *matplotlib* library. We just need that module, that's why we didn't imported the whole library.
    * *pyplot = plt*
    * *matplolib = our main plotting library*
