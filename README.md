# Super Important Introduction
I want to start by pointing two things:
* First of all I want to tell you that since I am really nerd and I want this to be a really fun thing to do, from now on, everything related to the learning process will be translated into an RPG game adventure.
* Second is that The resources on this repository will be useful for anyone who is on the path of learning *data science* or *programming*(with *python*). **But** before you start making any use of the data and resources that I will provide here, you need to undestand **my perspective about learning, what I'm aiming for and methods for approaching these topics.** So you can have a better idea of how this content may be helpful for you.
# Structure:
### The structure of the journey
* Basic/Foundational knowledge.
  * Starting to walk in certain direction.
    * The roadmap and resources of my learning process.
      * files, projects and personal stuff that could help you through your path.
