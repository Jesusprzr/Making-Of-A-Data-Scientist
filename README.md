# Super Important Introductory Phase:
I want to start by pointing two things:
* First of all I want to tell you that since I am really nerd and I want this to be a really fun thing to do, from now on, everything related to the learning process will be translated into an RPG game adventure.
* Second is that the resources on this repository will be useful for anyone who is on the path of learning *data science* or *programming* (with *python*). **But** before you start making any use of the data and resources that I will provide here, you need to undestand **my perspective about learning, what I'm aiming for and the methods for approaching these topics.** So you can have a better idea of how this content may be helpful for you.

### Character creation 
In most RPG games, at the beginning of the story you need to select the class and attributes of your character. In our case is the same, but we will be only choosing the non-physical ones.
#### Choosing a class: 
Do you want to be a warrior? a rogue? a mage? or do you prefer a tank? 
Here I don't mean that you should choose a career. Like going for programming, data science, ML engineering, web developer or anything     else. Because if you think about it enough, you will see that the class selection is ultimately for choosing the fighting approach, tools and resources that will help us throught our journey.
You normally choose a class based on the fighting style that you like the most and also based on the benefits of the class. So in my case I would be a rogue.
Normally rogues are more lethal and gain XP faster, they are a class specialized on killing their target and leveling up fast. 
I didn't wanted to go to college because I think that there are more effective and objetive oriented resources out there. And there are also environmental and limiting-budged factors that make it impossible for me to pay education and even to find adequate education in the place where I live in. 
So because I want to be effective and because of my circuinstances, I not only want to learn more efficiently, but also faster. Because I'm on a need not only of knowledge but also of money to support myself and my family.
So I choosed to be a rogue. **Not interested on the difficulty or on how common the path was, but rather into having the necessary skils to be more effective and also to level up easily so I can land a job faster.**
When you are approaching any kind of specialization you want to do the same, you want to have clear what will be your approach for fighting, based on your circunstances, needs, resources and which you think is the style that better suits your interests. 

# Structure:
### The structure of the journey
* Basic/Foundational knowledge.
  * Starting to walk in certain direction.
    * The roadmap and resources of my learning process.
      * files, projects and personal stuff that could help you through your path.
