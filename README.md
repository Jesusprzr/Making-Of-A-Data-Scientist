# Important Contextualization
Before we get into the real deal, I want to put you into context so you understand the why of this repository, and more importantly... **How you can take advantage of it.** If you want to go straight forward to the content, read the **approach and structure** paragraphs and then the section about **disecting the journey**. From there you can go and dig into the resources and files uploaded here and start doing/learning Data Science.

## The Environment
Let's start by ploting the kind of environmental situation that gave bird to this practical and straight approach of Data Science.

I am 18 years old (at least by the time i'm writing this), I live in a third world country, in which more than 80% of the population lives in poberty, there is work, the problem is that most of the work doesn't pays enough to cover even the basic needs (there the reason of the high rate of poverty) and education is almost killed. What do I mean by education almost killed? Well... When universities have almost no professors, it is common to not have classes and **uncommon** to be able to finish one semester, the instalations of the universities are just getting worst, the content and technologies of the available careers is just getting outdated, and the worst of everything... There is almost no opportunities, economically, and professionally to do anything in this country once you graduate of college. 

## THE FUEL, DRIVE AND REASON OF EVERYTHING
With this terrible landscape, Am I going to sit down, cry, and think "why me", or wait for someone to come and save me or a pollitical change that magically turns things to better? **Certainly not!** I have too much reasons (most of those reasons are human souls) to fight for. I am fucking sick of watching my dad, with the age that he has (56 years old) breaking his back working to just get the food in the table every month, my mother can't even go to do a fucking medical exam or go to the dentist to check a tooth, and my nephews are all separated and can't have the life of a normal kid. **So there is no fucking reason to sit down and cry, there is too much to fight for!**

## The Need
So, with this situation there is certain thing that could change lots of things (*coff coff, not redundat*), not everything but it could cover the things that disturb my existence, things such as completely supporting my family so my father doesn't have to work any more and therefore he could spend his time as he wants (probably with his grandchildrens and visiting the ones that are far), my mom being able to take care of her health, being able to so something as mundane but also as rewarding as taking my newphies out or to meet those newphies that are far. I even have a newborn newphie, he was born the same day of my birthday and I have not meet him yet! I could keep going, but I won't, this thing gives me fuel but also drains my mental health... 

So as you already guessed, that need of which I am talking about is called **money.**
I think that you may agree that in my case, money is the biggest priority. In case that you disagree, here you also have a graph about a really subjetive and arbitrary topic, but that comes to the case and has lots of data to support it.
I'm talking about happiness measured by income.

Money isn't everyting. But when you are in a case like mine, really under that 5K$ mark, and on this sort of situation... I think that **money literally does buys happines.**

## Putting Things On Perspective
Okay, now that we know the environmental situation, the reason (fuel), and the biggest priority to overcome this situation. What is the action plan? Well... Is clearly not what I thought two years ago. Recently when I was just graduating from school I was on my way to become a trader on the FOREX and cryptocurrency  markets. At that moment I had a little money to invest on the markets, our (the whole family) financial situation wans't this bad, and the political and economic landscape besides of not being or seeing good for the future, wasn't as catastrophic as it is today. So I was hungry of learning, and as I a am today (but not needing it this badly) hungry of financial wealth. So, for the last two years I have been learning and investing on the financial markets. Sadly, things dind't work out so well and now I am totally and completely broke... and of course, I am not financially or emotionally able to do it bi the time being. 

Besides of all the negative shit that I have said so far, in reality I have learned a lot about technical analysis, the financial markets, and one of the most important skills that I have learned in my life. The **strenght/resilience/endurance** to cross the entire hell and keep looking forwad, keep walking and overcoming every stepping stone. Actually I even don't plan to leave trading, it is just that it is not emotionally and economically possible for me to do it right now, but that's a fact! **I will conquer those bastard markerts!** Also, as you already readed before, I have too much to fight for. So I'm just driven and won't ever stop, I won't even stop after achieving that economical need that I have, that's just a short term goal. I have a lot more reasons to not stop.

We are still putting things on perspective. Now it is time to focus on the things that are inside our circle of influence (reference to the 7 habits of highly effective people) A.K.A. What we can control.

We started by describing the **environmental situation** to know how limited we are, and what possibilities we have. Then we moved to **the why**, which is pretty important because you need a strong reason and fuel to cross hell. Then we moved to **the need**, which is money and finally we **stated** and added motivation to some **core ethics** and created a comrpomise to keep going even if we need to go to the confines of hell (or at least that's why I tried to transmit). Now it is time for a more objetive and analytic approach.

## A Light In The Dark
I may not have to much physical opportunities on my environment, neither financially. But I still have two privileges that exeed everything else! a computer and internet. 

Frankly, I have never liked that much stuff like University. I have always thought that specialized, deliveratedly practiced and showcased skills beat anything else, that's a huge reason why I didn't enter college after graduating from school. The provilege of having a tool like a computer and access to the internet solves all of my impediments:
 * Educational impediments: Wiped out because you can learn enough even to beat Elon Musk on a space race. All through the internet.
 * Financial impediments: Wiped out because you can learn nearly everything free on the internet.
 * Job impediments: Destroyed, I think I don't need to explain how much possibilities there are on the internet to make money through data science. Not only data science, but everything (another thing is that is obviously not easy). 


# Making Of A Datan Scientist Structure:
 1. Understand the big picture.
 2. Know the full workflow process.
 3. First things first, focus on what matters.
 4. Master your creation with deliverate practice.
 5. Build a portfolio that leaves no doubt of your capacity.
 6. Build connections by adding value with your work or knowledge.
 7. The door is open, cross it. Time for effective and efficient management.

## Disecting Our Self-Creation Journey


### 1. Understand the bif picture


### 2. Now that we have the tools and know how to use them, out learning process will become slightly different. Now we want to keep learning but more importantly, start implementing what we already know and **start building our portfolio.** This will allow us to really forge what we learned before into our brain while building a portfolio and also keep learning new things that will be really useful.
   * Data Science project
   * *SQL* for data science
   * *PostgreSQL* Up and Running
### 3. With knowledge on R, SQL and a portfolio that is being enhanced at time pases and mirrors our abilities show get us on a good position for landing a DS job and start aquiring experience. But we don't want to stop learning! Now what we want to do is increase more our attention to our portfolio and linking with others. These two things will be our main focus, but we will also keep learning, but it just won't be our main target. 
   * Portfolio Enhancement
   * Gaining exposure and linking 
   * *Python* for Data Analysis (O'Reilly)
### 4. Now we want to specialize ourselves more so is time to gain more knowledge about AI and big data.
   * Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow (O'Reilly)
   * Hadoop The Definitive Guide (O'Reilly)
