# What's this all about?
This repository is intended to be where I keep the documentation and structure of my learning process while giving access to the resources for anyone who wants to follow my learning path and approach.
# Structure:
### I will structure it on the following format: 
* Basic/Foundational knowledge.
  * An overview of the discipline that I am learning.
    * The roadmap and resources of my learning process.
      * files, projects and personal stuff that could help you through your path.
