# Structure:
### Self Creation Structure:
 1. Understand the big picture.
 2. Know the full workflow process.
 3. First things first, focus on what matters.
 4. Master your creation with deliverate practice.
 5. Build a portfolio that leaves no doubt of your capacity.
 6. Build connections by adding value with your work or knowledge.
 7. The door is open, cross it. Time for effective and efficient management.

# DS Straight Learning & Implementation:
1. First of all we want to have the sufficient tools and knowledge to apply data science. So we will begin with some hard theory but that will be translated in the capacity to start doing data science projects right away.
   * *R* for Data Science (O'Reilly)
     * Explore
     * Wrangle
     * Program
     * Model
     * Communicate
2. Now that we have the tools and know how to use them, out learning process will become slightly different. Now we want to keep learning but more importantly, start implementing what we already know and **start building our portfolio.** This will allow us to really forge what we learned before into our brain while building a portfolio and also keep learning new things that will be really useful.

   * *SQL* for data science
   * *PostgreSQL* Up and Running
3. With knowledge on R, SQL and a portfolio that is being enhanced at time pases and mirrors our abilities show get us on a good position for landing a DS job and start aquiring experience. But we don't want to stop learning! Now what we want to do is increase more our attention to our portfolio and linking with others. These two things will be our main focus, but we will also keep learning, but it just won't be our main target. 
   * Portfolio Enhancement
   * Gaining exposure and linking 
   * *Python* for Data Analysis (O'Reilly)
4. Now we want to specialize ourselves more so is time to gain more knowledge about AI and big data.
