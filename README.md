# Important Contextualization
Before we get into the real deal, I want to put you into context so you understand the why of this repository, and more importantly... **How you can take advantage of it.** If you want to go straight forward to the content, read the **approach and structure** paragraphs and then the section about **disecting the journey**. From there you can go and dig into the resources and files uploaded here and start doing/learning Data Science. 

## The Environment
Let's start by ploting the kind of environmental situation that gave bird to this practical and straight approach of Data Science.

I live in a third world country, in which more than 80% of the population lives in poberty, there is work, the problem is that most of the work doesn't pays enough to cover even the basic needs (from there the high rate of poverty), and education is almost killed. What do I mean by education almost killed? Well... When universities have almost no professors, is common to have classes suspended and **uncommon** to be able to    


# Making Of A Datan Scientist Structure:
 1. Understand the big picture.
 2. Know the full workflow process.
 3. First things first, focus on what matters.
 4. Master your creation with deliverate practice.
 5. Build a portfolio that leaves no doubt of your capacity.
 6. Build connections by adding value with your work or knowledge.
 7. The door is open, cross it. Time for effective and efficient management.

## Disecting Our Self-Creation Journey


### 1. Understand the bif picture


### 2. Now that we have the tools and know how to use them, out learning process will become slightly different. Now we want to keep learning but more importantly, start implementing what we already know and **start building our portfolio.** This will allow us to really forge what we learned before into our brain while building a portfolio and also keep learning new things that will be really useful.
   * Data Science project
   * *SQL* for data science
   * *PostgreSQL* Up and Running
### 3. With knowledge on R, SQL and a portfolio that is being enhanced at time pases and mirrors our abilities show get us on a good position for landing a DS job and start aquiring experience. But we don't want to stop learning! Now what we want to do is increase more our attention to our portfolio and linking with others. These two things will be our main focus, but we will also keep learning, but it just won't be our main target. 
   * Portfolio Enhancement
   * Gaining exposure and linking 
   * *Python* for Data Analysis (O'Reilly)
### 4. Now we want to specialize ourselves more so is time to gain more knowledge about AI and big data.
   * Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow (O'Reilly)
   * Hadoop The Definitive Guide (O'Reilly)
