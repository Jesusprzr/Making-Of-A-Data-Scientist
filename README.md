# Description
Before we get into the real deal, I want to put you into context so you understand the why of this repository, and more importantly... **How you can take advantage of it.** If you want to go straight forward to the content, read **the approach and structure** paragraphs and then the section about **disecting the journey**. From there you will have the idea of how to dig into the resources and files uploaded here and start doing/learning Data Science.
