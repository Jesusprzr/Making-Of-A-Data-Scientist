# What's this all about?
This repository is intended to be where I keep the documentation and structure of my learning process while giving the resources to anyone who wants to follow my learning paths.
# Structure:
I will structure it on the following format:
Basic - Foundational knowledge
  The discipline path that I am going through.
    The resources that I am using to learn the discipline.
      files, projects and personal stuff that could help you through your path.
