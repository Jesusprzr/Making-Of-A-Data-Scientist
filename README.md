# Super Important Introductory Phase:
I want to start by pointing two things:
* First of all I want to tell you that since I am really nerd and I want this to be a really fun thing to do. from now on, everything related to the learning process will be translated into an RPG game adventure.
* Second is that the resources on this repository will be useful for anyone who is on the path of learning *data science* or *programming* (with *python*). **But** before you start making any use of the data and resources that I will provide here, you need to undestand **my perspective about learning, what I'm aiming for and the methods for approaching these topics.** So you can have a better idea of how this content may be helpful for you.

### Character creation - Choosing a class:
In most RPG games, at the beginning of the story you need to select the class of your character. This is what will define our fighting style, the tools, attributes and resources that help us to overcome every obstacle along the journey.
In our case is the same, but we will be only choosing the non-physical ones.
Do you want to be a warrior? a rogue? a mage? or do you prefer a tank? 
You normally choose a class based on the fighting style that you like the most and also based on the benefits of the class and how they fit your interests. 
In my case I would be a rogue, because they are more lethal and gain XP faster, they are a class specialized on killing their target and leveling up fast, they are objective oriented, they focus on one target and in dealing the most damage possible.
### Why is it so important and how is it so beneficial to choose a class?
extrapolate to different layers of the topic, like your ultimate goal of needing money but also based on what you like, so choosing what will give it to you faster and what you will enhoy more. Or like for choosing how you will learn the stuff that will get you to that goal. Choosing how you will aquire those skills that will help you to acomplish the big thing.
It will also make you clarify your strenghts and tastes. It will make you clarify your interests and what's more beneficial towards those interests. 
I didn't wanted to go to college because I think that there are more effective and objective oriented resources out there. And there are also environmental and limiting-budged factors that make it impossible for me to pay education and even to find adequate education in the place where I live in. 
So because I want to be effective and because of my circuinstances, I not only want to learn more efficiently, but also faster. Because I'm on a need not only of knowledge but also of money to support myself and my family.
So I choosed to be a rogue. **Not interested on the difficulty, time, effort, or on how common the path was, but rather into having the necessary skills to be more effective and also to level up easily so I can land a job faster.**
When you are approaching any kind of specialization you want to do the same, you want to have clear what will be your approach for fighting, based on your circunstances, needs, resources and which you think is the style that better suits your interests. 

# Structure:
### The structure of the journey
* Basic/Foundational knowledge.
  * Starting to walk in certain direction.
    * The roadmap and resources of my learning process.
      * files, projects and personal stuff that could help you through your path. 

# DS Straight Learning & Implementation:
1. First of all we want to have the sufficient tools and knowledge to apply data science. So we will begin with some hard theory but that will be translated in the capacity to start doing data science projects right away.
   * *R* for Data Science (O'Reilly)
     * Explore
     * Wrangle
     * Program
     * Model
     * Communicate
2. Now that we have the tools and know how to use them, out learning process will become slightly different. Now we want to keep learning but more importantly, start implementing what we already know and **start building our portfolio.** This will allow us to really forge what we learned before into our brain while building a portfolio and also keep learning new things that will be really useful.
   * Data Science project
   * *SQL* for data science
   * *PostgreSQL* Up and Running
3. With knowledge on R, SQL and a portfolio that is being enhanced at time pases and mirrors our abilities show get us on a good position for landing a DS job and start aquiring experience. But we don't want to stop learning! Now what we want to do is increase more our attention to our portfolio and linking with others. These two things will be our main focus, but we will also keep learning, but it just won't be our main target. 
   * Portfolio Enhancement
   * Gaining exposure and linking 
   * *Python* for Data Analysis (O'Reilly)
4. Now we want to specialize ourselves more so is time to gain more knowledge about AI and big data.
   * Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow (O'Reilly)
   * Hadoop The Definitive Guide (O'Reilly)
