##  What is that thing called "wrangling"?
data wrangling is the process of reshaping, aggregating, separating, or otherwise **transforming your data from one format to a more useful one.**

##  Our Aim
Run a step-forward analysis to analyze the effectiveness of a rudimentary momentum strategy that goes like this:

     At the start of every month, we buy the cryptocurrency that had the largest price gain over the previous 7, 14, 21, or 28 days. We want to evaluate each of these time windows.
    Then, we hold for exactly 7 days and sell our position.

## Our question
How well would we go about evaluating this strategy?

All the hard work in this task, lies in molding the data in the proper format. Once we have a proper *ABT*, answering the question becomes simple. Since this guide doesn't go deep into every subject, it is a good idea to have the [pandas library documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) open on another tab as supplemental reference. 

## 1 - Getting Our Notebook Ready
First of all, create a notebook for this tutorial.

Now import the libraries and dataset:
  
    #Pandas for managing datasets 
    import pandas as pd

Since this dataset has lots of decimals. Let's tweak the display options a bit and display floats with 2 decimals to make the tables less crowed. Let's also expand the limits for the numbers of columns and rows displayed.

    # Display floats with 2 decimal places
    pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format
    
    # Expand display limits
    pd.options.display.max_rows = 200
    pd.options.display.max_columns = 100

Now [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zgKTySGWDzrf4OE9Cs22ueS0_ZNg69YJ/view) the dataset and put it on the same directory as the notebook and run the following code to import and run example observations of the dataset:
